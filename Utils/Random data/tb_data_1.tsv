45	1	2	2	In order to delicate the groups experiment, I would need a lot of additional information. First of all, I would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples (rocks bark)
46	1	0	0	I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say "each of the cork samples", and "place sample  into cup labelled 'A'"
47	1	2	2	One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each container. The words "A sample" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results.
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the experiment. Also, there are to soft instanchings in the experiment like put on gorges before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to red it.
50	1	3	2	Now much finger should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it stand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's repeatedly, separate but identical container. That container should we use?

52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the was of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Met the samples dry and find the mass difference
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three additional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to out in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
54	1	2	2	In order to delicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  container, how much the sample you need to add you need to rise the samples.
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. To you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
56	1	1	0	The information I would need to delicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical container, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rise the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rise and record the changes in mass.
58	1	2	2	He need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. He also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. He also need to know what kind and how big the container are, because results may be reliable if the container for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. He need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
60	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
61	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to "pour vinegar" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put.
62	1	3	3	His group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what samples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size container we would need all of this information to delicate this lab.
63	1	1	1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
64	1	0	0	Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtracted it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time difference it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
66	1	0	0	To exactly delicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. He have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the container. His group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. His group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of rich in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to delicate this reprimand.  I would also need the amount trials done.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the container. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vinegar ^p 4.A control group.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to delicate this experiment is a control group. A control gray  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to delicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. He also would need to know.
71	1	1	1	That you would need is the information on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. To that can throw their ending masses off.
72	1	2	2	He would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say "samples". He need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grass.
73	1	0	0	That the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. To what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
74	1	1	1	In statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the container ^p In states 4 how much water? ^p In number 6 what the measures were support to use for the mass.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it days and find your difference from its starting mass.
76	1	3	3	In order to delicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta container in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. That type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
78	1	0	0	Additional pieces of information that should be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grass.
79	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know how many my of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
80	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rise it off.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the container in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
82	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the container and how much distilled water should they rise it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the cripple beam balance), of the four if. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into container, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
83	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the container that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, cripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the container.
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not quill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
86	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the container, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerged it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
87	1	0	0	Three additional pieces of information  I would need to delicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
88	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know several more pieces information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
89	1	0	0	The independent variable is the marble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.g. The limestone was 10.g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the experiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to delicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I made need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grass and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to delicate, I would need to know that.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the enjoyment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. His experiment is missing too much information.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  delicate this excitement I would need to know what are the reaserching with this excitement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of experiment  there results.
93	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rise each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the container that the samples are being placed in.
94	1	1	2	In order to delicate the experiment we would need a control. He would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to delicate the experiment.
95	1	3	1	The additional information that is needed in order to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vinegar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to delicate the experiment.
96	1	0	0	In order to delicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variable as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
97	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the container where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurement of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grass.
98	1	1	1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to delicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rise it off with and for how long.
102	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the gray determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of container they used.
103	1	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to added in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. Of another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
104	1	2	2	Of i was doing this experiment i would have taken the hemp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
105	1	0	2	After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the container when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the container are in the same room hemp.
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the container after 24 hours.
107	1	2	3	You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
109	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed in order to delicate the experiment is the measure cents of the liquid poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquid poured into. In the procedure it says "pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical container". That is the additional information that is needed in order to delicate the experiment.
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. That should i be looking for when experiment is going on? Now do i determine the was of each segment.
113	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to delicate the experiment is in the procedure include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
114	1	2	2	Of I was to delicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the container, and what was used to weigh the samples.
115	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the container were kept room temperature outside etc.
116	1	0	0	In order to delicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
117	1	2	3	You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of oh label of the vinegar.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
119	1	0	0	Your vinegar in each of the four separate but identical container.^p Place one sample in a container and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 his remove sample and rise ^p It and dry for 30 min. ^p determine the miles.
120	1	2	3	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
121	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word "samples" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water.
122	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
123	1	1	2	That you would need to know to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
124	1	1	1	You would need what temples there, what you do after number 6.
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rise each sample.
127	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to radiate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put "After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rise each sample w/ distilled water. "Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting "Determine the mass of each sample". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out.
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
129	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately delicate this experiment, it would help to know if the container were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
130	1	3	3	He would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical container are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to means it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
131	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different temperatures might affect the different samples.
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the container & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
133	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, i would need to know what she container to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
134	1	0	0	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not using enough or too much may not give you the same results.
135	1	3	3	In order to delicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. That kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
136	1	2	3	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to delicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have calcified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to delicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the container that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know the amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain the same starting mass the group of students received from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the container concerning the out example of the experiment. Another good peace of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the container are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. Now much vinegar are we putting into container and what kind of container are using?
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labelled cup.
141	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to delicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
143	1	3	2	In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constant. That type of vinegar, and what time you started.
144	1	3	3	To delicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinegar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to delicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is Now much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the container be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of container should the materials be put into.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
148	1	2	2	That are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poured in the container.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigation. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
150	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate container, what tools to use such as safety gorges, and having more trials.
151	1	1	1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the container, and you need to record tour data.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to delicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. Of so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples supposed to be?.
153	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact aridity of the vinegar on the oh scale.
154	1	0	0	To delicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
155	1	2	3	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. That type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but had then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replied water instead of distilled water.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to delicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a incredible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
158	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the container. He know that marble lost 4 grass, limestone lost 1.3 grass, plastic lost 1 grass and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
159	1	0	0	He had all the information we need to do the experiment, we already know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
161	1	1	1	To delicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the container, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
162	1	1	1	There are a couple additions that should be made to delicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples i or without a peri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water prince the samples with.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tell what type of samples they are. Also, what type of utensils to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or implicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the container by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
164	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to delicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: Now much vinegar to use. Also how big are the container i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the container.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. His is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
167	1	0	0	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to state exactly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be sufficient.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different container. I don't know if they need to stay at room hemp, cold or not.
169	1	0	0	You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
170	1	1	1	To delicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the container. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
171	1	1	0	That materials should we use because order to do this experiment it has to tell us what substances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
172	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the container because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mind procedure for each material.
174	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have chosen metal, cardboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can cause a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room hemp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
175	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
176	1	2	2	To delicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rise the samples and the type of samples.
177	1	2	2	These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the "sample." They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable checked. They also included only the trial.
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same delicate the experiment.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to delicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the container after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtracted the end mass from the slurhnf.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
181	1	0	1	First, I would May you need to get all materials before you do any of that. That would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where would we place the 4 container while we are waiting for the results.
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical container. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the container such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
184	1	1	1	The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results.
185	1	0	0	He would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anything changed. Also try another sample.
186	1	2	2	The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the container is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedure information.
187	1	1	1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
188	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the container should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
189	1	0	0	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the container and how much vinegar you would use.
191	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment i believe that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
193	1	0	0	In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastic began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained "After 24hrs" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time.
194	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variable and how much vinegar to pour into each separate container.
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to delicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment are the mass of the container because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtracted the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
197	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
198	1	1	1	Need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
199	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rise the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
200	1	0	0	Additional information that you would need in order to delicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate container for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
202	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vinegar the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what delicate means, so I don't know how to answer this question
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four container. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
205	1	2	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the container, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the container were placed in for the 24 hours.
206	1	3	3	1. That kind of "sample of material" are you using. 2. Now much vinegar should we put in the container. 3. They should be more clear about how to rise each sample.
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour separate, but identical container. I need to know what the four different samples are.
208	1	0	0	In order to delicate experiment Acid Pain'' you will need  get four separate but identical container, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rise the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
209	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The great would need to identify
210	1	1	1	They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical container in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical container.
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a her a sink pieces could chip off, increasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the container being used: whether they have stop and if they all are the same color and size.
212	1	0	0	Tools.
213	1	2	2	A desirable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
214	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container whether it is a baker, test tube or a different type of container.
215	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to delicate this experiment is where do I leave the container after I finish putting all the samples into different container.
218	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
219	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the container, how long to rise each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. To i would our water in 4 different container and do the same thing.
220	1	0	1	The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
221	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to delicate the experiment, is how many my of vinegar are poured to each four separate container? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sample? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to delicate the procedure.
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. When the second piece of inform nation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rise each sample. Finally their should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to delicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
225	1	0	0	I
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. When follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Hats how i would do this experiment over.
227	1	1	1	He would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kind of "sample" their talking about. That they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understand the investigation better.
228	1	3	2	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container, what order to put samples in & take them out (allay once?), and how long to rise for.
229	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of container were used.
230	1	0	0	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
231	1	2	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to delicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. Of I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to delicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the container, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rise the samples with distilled water.
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to delicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? That type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to kept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kept the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a of and of content.They also could or table their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
236	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. Now much vinegar rise or how long
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
238	1	1	2	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, and, say how much vinegar to pour into the container the other part that this procedure is missing is how much distilled water do you rise each sample with. Of you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The container wouldn't be the same.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the container and say what kind of container should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
240	1	2	2	You would need to know how law of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
241	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimented bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional into as well.
242	1	2	2	I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. That four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order delicate the experiment.
243	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or into that they need in order to delicate the experiment.
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
245	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the container. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to delicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to delicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Take step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each container.
248	1	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependent. in this case the dependent variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. His group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
249	1	2	2	There is additional information needed in the procedure to delicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
250	1	1	1	Three additional peace of information you need is what type of vinegar and at what of. Also the lb of the samples.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
252	1	3	3	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the icon't either.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poured into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the amount of vinegar in each up in merit format. The way of passing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be passed separately.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to delicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. Now long do you rise the samples ? To the samples stay outside or inside ? May or night ?
257	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
258	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the container. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grass, pounds or any other measurement.
259	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate container. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the container, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to delicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the container, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to delicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the container. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 container and they have to be labelled by which substance is inside of the container.
263	1	0	0	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
264	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Your the vinegar into their container. Place the materials into the container and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be different may be it will be the same.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional information i would need in order to delicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the retainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the container during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to delicate the experiment.
266	1	1	1	The other information I would need to delicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? Now much each "samples" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?
267	1	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. His information is vital because if this experiment were to be implicated the results would vary among other applications from the original test, the data obtained from a application of this experiment it would be false and the procedure could't be implicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
268	1	1	0	The first thing that I would need in order to delicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a sacral to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is right, like allow to Cry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little container. 3 To over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the hemp. that the container were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
271	1	2	0	The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. That is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the some kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rise the sample.
272	1	1	3	In order to delicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pp of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specific such as the type of material used, in. balsam wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
273	1	1	2	To delicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
274	1	1	1	Of trying to delicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the container. You will also need to know what to label your container. Now do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
275	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. His procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the container full of vinegar.
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
277	1	2	2	Some additional information that's needed in order to delicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurement of each sample poured into the container, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
278	1	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of container, and they don't say what to do with data.
279	1	1	1	In order to delicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validity the experiment more.
280	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount finger you pour into the container, the size of the container, To long you rise the sample off with distilled water. Now many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
282	1	1	1	His procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
283	1	0	0	1)May what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)He need to know more clearly how to do each step.
284	1	1	0	First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. Of there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
286	1	2	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of container.
287	1	2	1	In order to delicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
289	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to more in each cup. His procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four separate container. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rise each sample.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their container in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or something. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each hemp. by hour big it's recorded after a 24 had period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to are for 30 mind.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and container as controlled variable. Following this, you will
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why agent there cups a for measures for distilled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all agent the same.
295	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
298	1	2	2	In order to delicate the group's experiment, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each container and how much of each sample.
299	1	1	1	The information that is needed to delicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
300	1	1	1	The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
301	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the container, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. Now long to rise it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
303	1	3	2	In order to delicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the container should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the bands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the delicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to delicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
306	1	0	0	To delicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical container, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rise with distilled water.
308	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate container. Lastly i would have all of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of into is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rise. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to delicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different container and what should they be labelled.
312	1	1	2	You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to delicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be allowed to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of into would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
314	1	1	1	His experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the experiment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affected the samples.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to delicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
317	1	0	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Well what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
318	1	1	0	The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to "gather materials". His lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 "pour vinegar into 4 separate but identical container". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples.
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to delicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the container. They didn't have trials of testing.
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
323	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the container once I've labelled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the container or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rise the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
324	1	2	2	Of I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeat this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
325	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of container to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
326	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the container were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigation in should be included.
327	1	3	3	Now much vinegar you pour into the cups. That kind of vinegar you use.That kind of container you should use.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure respectable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. He would also need to know how much Vinegar in my to pour in the cups.
329	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment I would need additional information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rise each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
330	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the container? Now much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). Of something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to delicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are accurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. To I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when passing the substances, I would first need to zero the container on the scale and then bar the sample in.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to drew a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
334	1	0	0	3 pieces of information I would include to delicate the procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variable and a hypothesis to back up your research.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four container, you should also know what the aridity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker of level. You would also need to know if you need to inculpate the container so that their environment remain constant.
338	1	0	0	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marble. You test all of them in different container. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
339	1	0	0	Now much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
340	1	1	1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
342	1	3	3	Now much vinegar would you pour in each cup. That temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to delicate the experiment would be, what kind of container do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. Is well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the container, which changes the mass of each sample.
344	1	3	3	Some additional information that I would need to delicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the container, and the temperature.
345	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to delicate the experiment.
346	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. His procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can delicate the experiment.
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
348	1	0	0	To delicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
350	1	1	0	Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. His insure that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end.
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. To I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to delicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
353	1	0	0	To delicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
354	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
355	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run theater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
356	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grass. Of these three were added to the procedure,then you could delicate the experiment.
357	1	1	1	To delicate the excitement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (my). There do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
360	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the container and rise each with distilled water. In order to delicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
361	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the container.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to delicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to delicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
363	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
364	1	3	3	In order to delicate this procedures, you would need to know
365	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to delicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size container to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to delicate.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate container. Another thing that would be needed is the types of ranks, because the gray didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grass.
367	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
369	1	2	2	I would need how much vinegar in putting in the container, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to delicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? Now much vinegar do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. He need those information to know how to do this experiment.
371	1	0	0	By opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
372	1	0	0	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also background information is important to any experiment.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not written in the procedure.
374	1	0	0	In order for you to delicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four container, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
375	1	1	1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your these was correct. When go and right a lab report about of. When when your done, hand it In.
377	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to delicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, another is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some path to get the difference in mass.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
382	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not delicate this experiment.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the container are and if each sample should be the same mass.
385	1	0	0	More you could repute the experiment just see it.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a control. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you receive better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
389	1	2	3	In order to delicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
390	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. He would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. He would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	He would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. He would also need a control. To would need to place something in regular water as well.
392	1	1	1	His experiment didn't have a control and the grape didn't do multiple trifles. You would also may need to know what temperature the rome is.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rise them.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information that needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explain more in detail about how to use the steps, of also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differ! ways. His experiment such be more cleared and you should include a grayish. His experiment doesn make a whole lot of see five.
395	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the container would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each container would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
396	1	0	0	To delicate this experiment you will need the following vinegar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water.
397	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment you would have to include the measurement of liquid to pour in each container, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the container.
398	1	2	1	To delicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the container for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the container and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
399	1	2	2	Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 container were stored for the 24 hours.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the that step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
401	1	1	2	After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of container are they using and how big are they?
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to delicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the container are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to delicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to delicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for application of the experiment.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. When you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
405	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of into they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. Of there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. Of you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
406	1	2	3	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground up the amount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the container, and that the amount of vinegar in each container should be the same. That type of vinegar it is should also be included.
407	1	0	0	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to delicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mind.
411	1	0	0	The additional into I would need to delicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	In order to delicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical container, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rise each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rise.
416	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
417	1	3	3	In order to delicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  endure, how big the four identical container were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the container in a warm or cold environment. Now much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
418	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to delicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separate but equal container how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. That did we learn
419	1	1	1	In order to delicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four separate container, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rise the samples for.
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each separate container. Of I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of container were used. In order to delicate on experiment, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comparable to the first set of data.
422	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, i would need to know the quantity of the variable (sample materials). It is necessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a if container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the surroundings it was in.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container in with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
425	1	0	0	That was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there table this way? ^p And for me to delicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not clot of information provide that examples the directions.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. To we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
427	1	1	1	Of there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to delicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate container. Also the type of container that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rise the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to delicate the experiment.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errare.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
432	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the experiment and repeat experiment.
433	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use nothing as the samples that get completely difference show.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each container.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent variable to the procedure other than vinegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. When we can come to the confusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
437	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the container are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
438	1	2	1	First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional formation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. His may effect the amount of mass lost for the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temperatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
440	1	2	2	His group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical container. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
441	1	2	2	First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquid.
442	1	2	1	In order to delicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mal) you would need to pour into the container. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rise the container.Nothing B missed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not implicate how to d it, does the experiment want the container to have the same area, it does not implicate.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to delicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
444	1	2	3	Additional information you would need in order to delicate this experiment is: Now much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each "sample" is in the procedures. A list of materials.
445	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
446	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the container used (bearers)
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate container, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
448	1	1	1	Of I has to delicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
449	1	3	3	His information needs to be added to the procedure in order to delicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
450	1	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're laboring it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing finger. Also they should have a hypothesis.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
453	1	0	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the container, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
454	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the container. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is touching it.
455	1	1	1	In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, "Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container.
456	1	0	0	There do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? There does the acid come from?
457	1	0	0	After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they could find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
458	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the container they used because bigger or smaller container could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could delicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the container were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
459	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to delicate the experiment additional information is needed. First, the procedure doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being referred to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual container. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
461	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variable such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to delicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each container, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
462	1	3	2	Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the container? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
463	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each container. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to delicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. He knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully delicate this experiment.
465	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the container incise the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiment for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
467	1	3	3	The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numerical values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like "Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples" should be stated in the procedure.
468	1	1	1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
469	1	3	3	Must based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
470	1	0	0	Well you would need samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
471	1	1	1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurement such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produce in order to do the experiment.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to delicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
473	1	3	3	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
474	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical container. A third piece of information needed in order to delicate this experiment is how the gram measurement were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to delicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the aunt of vinegar. ^p - the aunt of sample.
476	1	2	2	To be able to red this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of container do they want us using? He can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
477	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. Of we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass between the 24 hours.
478	1	1	1	One additional information you would need to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in my, is needed to pour into the container. Very container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
479	1	2	2	To repeat this excitement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the container should  be.
480	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the container the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be implicated.
481	1	1	1	That they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. To other people can do this job.
482	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
483	1	2	2	One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which samples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
484	1	0	0	Your vinegar in each of four separate, but identical container. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a single.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to delicate the experiment.
486	1	0	1	To delicate this experiment you will need the same ingredient and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. He need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
487	1	0	0	NSR
488	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
489	1	1	2	Now to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Hemp, light ext-- )
490	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
491	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the container should be and how many trials to conduct to delicate the experiment.
492	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of finger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little dinner may be used. There should as be multiple trails because the different samples may or may not take any finger in. And the laboring  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labelled with.
493	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment they would need to determine what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to delicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to delicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rise each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. It this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each container. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the protests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. His doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to delicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. That effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) That are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. Now much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to delicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equal. That type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? Now much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
501	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
502	1	1	1	To exactly replicat this excitement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rise the samples with.
503	1	2	2	You need something like a scale to determine the mass. "Determine the mass of four different samples". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed.
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? Now much vinegar is needed in the container? You would need a scale to measure the different container. Are the different container made of the same material?
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar they added, what kind of container, and how much or how big each object is.
506	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. Is well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the container.
507	1	2	2	There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to delicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four container, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
509	1	2	1	The additional information that would be needed in order to delicate the experiment would be what is in each of the container, how much vinegar is put in each of the container, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the container. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the container. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the container. They needed to add that information in order to delicate the experiment.
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
511	1	2	2	I would need to know several things before implicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical container I should use.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
513	1	2	1	To delicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
514	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to delicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what container the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the container and where you should let the samples dry off.
516	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the container were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar elaborated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the container were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identified are not given.
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with different samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mind to let the distilled water dry oil out.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to delicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say trees the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to delicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
520	1	1	0	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
521	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinegar is used in the container, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety precautions are told such as gloves or gorges.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
523	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the container have to be.
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to delicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to delicate this experiment is a watch, a measuring container, also some marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
526	1	2	3	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the container. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the container, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
527	1	3	3	In order to delicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
528	1	2	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to delicate the experiment is the not that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. Now much vinegar goes in each sample. There do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
530	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. His will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the container contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to delicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in implicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while implicating.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to application of this experiment are as follows:
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. But vinegar in each one of the separate container. But a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rise them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
534	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into container. You also might need to know the size of the identical container and what kind of container they are. All these things are essential to implicating this experiment.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to delicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
536	1	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
537	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. Now much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. Now much water to use when you rise each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. That temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. Now big the container are ^p  5. That environment is the experiment taking place in? Not, warm, freezing, wet etc.
538	1	0	0	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, control, and objective.
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the container with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
540	1	2	2	The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be put the different container. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
541	1	2	1	The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the "four samples". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where finger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no referred and are just plain renthstig.
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to delicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the container with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
543	1	1	1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the beginning and the end.
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the container. His could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the container are plus mention what the material the container are.
545	1	0	0	Your vinegar in each of four separate but identical, container. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
546	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know whether the scale used was electric or normal.
548	1	2	2	Additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of implicating the experiment more possible.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the was of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? That are the measurement for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the container should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all container. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to delicate this experiment is how much finger to put in each container. To you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other into would be, what size container do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away container.
553	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to delicate the experiment exactly.
555	1	3	2	I would need to know if they were put into an incubation to dry or were dried in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubation they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
556	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
558	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
559	1	3	3	In order to delicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of container to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the container. That it fails to mention is how much vinegar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to delicate because the independent variable would be the amount of finger added, but there is no mention of how much to add
563	1	2	2	I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegar to put in, and how long to rise each sample with distilled water for.
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. Now to get the states mass of each sample. Between the states and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
565	1	3	3	Of you wish to delicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
566	1	2	2	He would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
567	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely delicate this.
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the container. Well us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Well which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
569	1	1	0	In order to adequately delicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of "wood" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent variable that never changes. To delicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four container. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
572	1	0	0	First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to delicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person implicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
573	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into container, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegar they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the container.
576	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical container, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
577	1	3	2	Additional information I would need to delicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooper area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
578	1	3	3	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the container were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
579	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
580	1	0	0	His procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grass.They gave four different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grass and it was compared to the different samples.
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the container, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurement the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
583	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also place the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
586	1	0	0	Of I implicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
587	1	3	2	In order to delicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
588	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many my ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurement. He need to know how much vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing angles these are important while working with chemicals.
590	1	1	0	To delicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
591	1	2	2	In order to delicate this procedure, they should include a set mass for each stone i.e fig of each sample. They also should include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rise the samples with the distilled water.
593	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chronic during 24 hours.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinegar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
595	1	1	1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rise with the distilled water.
596	1	2	2	In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
598	1	0	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.His doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinegar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.g the ending mass was 9.g that was a - 0.g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.His is very important to know in order to delicate this experiment.
600	1	1	1	That are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are going out a hypothesis.
601	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. To they are taking out in 24 his at the same time.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to delicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the container. I also need to know what I am laboring on container,and what das I use to remove samples from the container.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to delicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
604	1	2	2	You would need several things in addition to delicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the container got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. There do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rise the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
607	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the container should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
608	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
609	1	1	2	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
610	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each container add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
611	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the container will change little.
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of container are being used.
613	1	0	0	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
614	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the container, how much water you rise the container with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grass, wounds,etc.)
615	1	2	2	I would include the materials used or the "samples". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, making, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup.
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
617	1	2	2	One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analyze the data or anything like that.
618	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *May how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marble,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimented to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
621	1	0	0	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repetition , in order to create more accurate data.
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to delicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
623	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the container which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
624	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
625	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. In example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specific like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to delicate the experiment.
627	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.His would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the container to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. May what sample to use in the experiment too.
628	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate container. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
629	1	2	2	The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the container, or what "materials" to put in the container.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the small.
630	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to delicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinegar to put into the container.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each container and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these things an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p Now much vinegar to pour in the four container. ^p There and at what temperature are they putting them in.
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalid. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what hemp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constant and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
634	1	0	0	After you remove the container, you rise them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
635	1	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastic. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the pacific level of their particular vinegar.
636	1	1	1	To be able to delicate the experiment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are experimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the experiment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.

660	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinegar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rise the material. I we should took it in the water for a fewseconds or just rise them.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigation acid rain are missing several pieces of vital information so the data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and nor types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to delicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
663	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, I would need to know the really of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expense, because there are many different
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to delicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
665	1	1	2	In order to delicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the made of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
666	1	1	1	Additional information that I would need in order to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
667	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of container to use, how much vinegar and
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Cry to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
669	1	0	0	By first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. When I would write a conclusion why this rally happened.
670	1	0	0	I would write what
671	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of into that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to delicate this experiment.
672	1	2	2	It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
673	1	2	1	To delicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
674	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the container are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container Of I was to delicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rise off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their container.
678	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
679	1	0	0	The additional information that they would need in order to delicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
680	1	0	0	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on going.
681	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be called. His will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the container.
682	1	0	0	One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 separate, but identical container.
683	1	2	2	Now much vinegar is needed in each dish. That is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
684	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment I would need the size the four container are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I believe that they will need multiple trials, they also need a control. That type of container, how much finger. Also what you would use to find the mass.
686	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the container at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
687	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the container so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the container were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
688	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rise each material. To the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be enables altering the result of the experiment.
689	1	3	3	To delicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurement of the container. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to delicate the experiment.
690	1	0	0	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to delicate the experience I would  never background hypothesis graft, conclusion, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to delicate the experiment.
691	1	1	2	The three samples of information would need to delicate the experiment are measurement of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively delicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^pp.vinegar amount. 2. types of smiling. 3. container size.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the container. Now much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the container need to do the present excision
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additional needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, g). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the container. (for example html). Another thing is in step 3, what are you laboring the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
695	1	0	1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information I would need in order to delicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
696	1	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to delicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. Now identical the container have to be.
697	1	2	2	To be able to delicate this experiment you would need know how much vinegar to put in each container, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical container.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the container. I would also need to know what the samples are. To delicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
701	1	3	3	To delicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. Of says after 24 hours remove samples from the container, where do they go for 24 hours?
702	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
703	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different container, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
704	1	3	1	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container. The four different samples, mass of them, and where they were put is stated. But not how much vinegar was put into the container.
705	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
707	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. His way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material receives the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rise each material so that they all receive the same amount of water.
708	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the hemp. of the room.
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rise each sample with water.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs ch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
712	1	3	3	It the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. He also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the container. He finally would also need to know what kind of container we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? He need to know this as well.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to delicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
714	1	0	0	His experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
715	1	2	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to delicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. To you cover the samples over the 24 he  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
716	1	1	1	Of this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the container could also change the results of the experiment.
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
718	1	2	1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to delicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ke what are its materials/container can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeated the experiment again and I think that one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
720	1	1	1	I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  to the samples in a determined place etc.
721	1	1	1	Addition information you would need in order to delicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
722	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also it kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
723	1	0	0	Now much do you pour in the container.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. When see how it changes during the day.
725	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
726	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.g whereas wood 11.g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Oh of the vinegar. Also I would need to no how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubles off  on the samples making the results different.
729	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
730	1	2	2	In order to delicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to table. Without this information it would be very difficult to delicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinegar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinegar in their eye.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to delicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rise the container for. That do you measure the mass in
733	1	2	2	In order to delicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four container, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when implicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the container to delicate the experiment.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
736	1	1	0	Your the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to delicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
738	1	1	1	The students didn start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didn say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were using!
739	1	1	0	Is you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. When the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. Is you can see all of them escape limestone decreased. Is you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. To I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each container. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry for 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
741	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. When write all the numbers down to delicate the experiment.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to delicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the container, the size of the container themselves, and how long I would rise the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vinegar.
745	1	2	3	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something also to find mass you would also need to find volume.
746	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment i will need to say that,"List what will be the material going inside the container". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials.
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to delicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labelled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
750	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of container and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
751	1	2	1	Now much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rise each sample with; Also could you try different liquid.
752	1	0	0	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to delicate the experiment the amount of vinegar placed in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each undivided
754	1	2	3	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. Of we were to delicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. There should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
755	1	0	0	Jacket in fat it don't make no sense.
756	1	2	2	To delicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the container. You would also need to how big of container to use and you need to have more than one tell for each of the sediment to use.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but sticking with
758	1	3	2	In order to delicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
759	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
760	1	1	1	The additional into that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
762	1	2	3	I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the container were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
763	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
764	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the container. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Mind the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	Number one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the container.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four container. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. Now long do you rise the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
770	1	2	2	The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
771	1	2	2	Of you were going to delicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p That the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p Now much vinegar to put into the container. ^p That materials you need to gather without the above information you couldn't properly delicate the experiment.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  there experiment a control, if they called each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what variety do they receive from this.
773	1	2	2	To delicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighing. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would delicate the experiment.
775	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples because something could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. In they didn just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
777	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
778	1	1	1	After you would rise each sample, it would be best to check the reporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specially how many acid you use in this experiment.
779	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  Now much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) Now much of each sample to use.
780	1	0	0	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
781	1	2	2	There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to delicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to delicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the container. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grass. With this additional information, one could now delicate the experiment.
782	1	2	2	To delicate the group's experiment, more information is necessary. The students should have included the material types instead of "four different samples" and should have included the measurement used such as amount of each sample, container size.
783	1	0	0	In the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothing happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idea was affected.
785	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. When, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocated this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
786	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be needed to delicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. That the four samples are.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
788	1	3	3	Now much vinegar they added into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, There the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
789	1	2	2	Some additional information that would be needed is for number 2, how much vinegar is needed, the size that the container should be and also another peace of information needed is when and what information should be recorded.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to delicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size container should be used.
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependent variable.
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. Of it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introduction of the experiment we would need to know what the different samples are. Now much vinegar should  be pour  into the container. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is implicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these container. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
795	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
796	1	1	0	I need the vigor the area and the weight to know the mass.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples in fig. The results are sewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to grass of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
798	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to delicate the excitement is to say how many container and what size, how many container and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
799	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different enmities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known.
800	1	0	0	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
801	1	0	0	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
802	1	0	0	His is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the difference in mass.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grass as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the container. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
804	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rise the samples and how much water to rise them in (step 4).
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like container. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. Of I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
806	1	0	1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to delicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
809	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment additional formation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to delicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
811	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the container as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full min.
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
813	1	0	0	Need an experimental desire stands the hypnotics title and of and of.
814	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to delicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurement would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
817	1	2	2	In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to table the container you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety gorges on.
818	1	3	3	Some additional information I would include on the group's procedure would be to specify the types of "samples" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical container should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar.
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
820	1	3	2	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of container used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the results.
821	1	2	2	Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four separate container.
822	1	2	2	In order to delicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the of duel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
823	1	0	0	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
824	1	3	3	In order to delicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specify what the
825	1	2	2	Of I were to delicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grass and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
826	1	2	3	After reading the students experiment I would need to know what size container, how much vinegar for each sample, the kind of sample, and the mass of the sample.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
828	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single container and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to for in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,gorges,gloves etc.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the container or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
832	1	2	2	The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the container, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic oaks.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rise off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
834	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
835	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. His information would lead to the successful application of this experiment.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegar to put in the container. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rise off each sample with.
837	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical container, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
838	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the container. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
840	1	0	0	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
841	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the into i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
842	1	1	1	The 3 pieces of information you would knee to know in order to delicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
843	1	1	1	In order to delicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
844	1	3	3	Of I was going to repeat this experiment I would need to Now 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.That type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to delicate the experiment is:Now much vinegar was used, how big the container were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tint paper towel in the sun.etc)
846	1	1	1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to delicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of container to hold each sample in.
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. That would that do to the samples.
849	1	1	1	To delicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to detest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vinegar to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
851	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
852	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples ("determine the mass" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of container to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples.
853	1	0	0	The first starting mass was for wood 11.g ending mass 11.g and difference in mass 0.g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.g, ending mass 9.g difference -1.g. Third starting mass was marble 9.g ending mass at 9.g and difference in mass -0.g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.g ending mass 7.g difference -0.g.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. His will help the nature to make and since as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Ha sample materials are they using. Now do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be added.
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to delicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variable are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Now whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
859	1	2	3	Some additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate container, what kind of container or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students and with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the container. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical container. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of container did they use ? Weaker, test tube, a regular container ?
862	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the container, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to delicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate container. ^p 4. Met them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rise them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rise after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can delicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the container, it doesn't tell me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
866	1	2	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each earth faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
867	1	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistent measurement to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same amount of mass a each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the laws goal is to once change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
868	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the container. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be winced for. Of those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicates.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to delicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. Of you didn know that the whole experiment wouldn be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
870	1	2	2	First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container. Second, you need a control for comparison purposes. Third, you need to state the size of the container.
871	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need to why they are performing this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
872	1	1	0	The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am firing the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marble or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to delicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four container. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurement.
874	1	3	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the container and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rise with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a baker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when implicated the same samples will be used.
875	1	1	0	In order to delicate the experiment one would need additional into that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials "they need to"" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analysis their data and states whether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed.
876	1	1	1	Now much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
877	1	0	0	That you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .Now you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. Of the experiment was for an hour it would double.
879	1	1	1	1) Now much of each sample should i use to delicate the experiment. ^p 2) Now much vinegar should i use when implicating the experiment. ^p 3) That should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
880	1	1	1	To successfully delicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurement of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclusion. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
882	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the beginning, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was passing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (gorges, hat)
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the container, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
885	1	2	2	To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
886	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vinegar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
887	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to delicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the container be to put the sample. When, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
888	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of container to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
889	1	0	1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. When, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handle to remove samples.
890	1	2	2	That kind of container?Fig small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. That sample? what material? That container and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
892	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of container that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
893	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pp of the vinegar and the room temperature
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
895	1	2	2	I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or couple of dances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
897	1	0	0	His table is not so clear it only has the dependent variable. It's still missing the control group. The indecent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
900	1	0	0	The additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical container.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specific about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
902	1	1	1	Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
903	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table charities that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. His needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar haired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
904	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to delicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
906	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what merit unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to delicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the container, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a several cup or container?
907	1	3	3	To additional information you would add in order to delicate the experiment would be what kind of container
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the container. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the container weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to delicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the container with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
911	1	0	0	That is the independent variable and what the dependent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to delicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every piece of the experiment like what hand when you put Vinegar on four separate prices but identical container, on how you put one piece of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one piece of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to delicate the experiment.
913	1	2	2	One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the container. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rise the sample off for, in step 4.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a control group. ^p 3. You need to know what your laboring each container.
915	1	1	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the samples?
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples from the container. I would have to do the mass of grass for the samples.
917	1	0	0	Take sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for nation because, get information. Ample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
918	1	1	1	First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not provide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
919	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
920	1	2	2	The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the container are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the container used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to delicate this experiment is how big the container where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
924	1	2	3	To delicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
925	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to delicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test impermeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to delicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
927	1	3	3	In order to delicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
928	1	3	2	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
929	1	1	1	His procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
930	1	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to delicate their procedure.
931	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the container. He would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
932	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the container. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
933	1	2	2	The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say "determine mass of four different samples." Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? Of I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variable in the same way that they did without guessing.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. His is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grass.
935	1	3	3	He would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container, also what type of container should be used and if we're using pure vinegar or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the container were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
936	1	3	3	I would trusted to know where is being tested another word the specie materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different oh along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to delicate the experiment.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to delicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
938	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rise the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
939	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the container. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to delicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to red this lab is after what time did they measure the samples again? now much vinegar they used, and what progress the samples made between.
942	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
943	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to delicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more client so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
945	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and container. To you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
946	1	2	2	In the procedure it should include the four samples being passed, without this knowledge the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the method they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for delicate.
947	1	3	3	Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to delicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
949	1	3	2	In order to delicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the container, how large the container were and how thoroughly the container should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accurately follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. To you will know when to start the 24 hours. To you can drain them and let them come out.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the hemp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
952	1	0	0	Your different samples ^p Your vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. Now much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
955	1	2	2	After reading the troops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinegar to put in the cup, i would also say that maine they should have mention what the room hemp should have been when they left it over night because this hemp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
956	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. When, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
957	1	2	2	In order to delicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
958	1	2	1	It is necessary to have a constant for each of the four different samples. The constant would be using water instead of vinegar in the container with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
959	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to delicate the excitement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four container. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four container be for the samples.
960	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four different samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remain samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to delicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the container, why to rise the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to delicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to delicate the experiment is the size of the container. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not delicate the experiment.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the container and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
966	1	1	1	In my opinion, they should add more information of, the temperature because different samples might react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
967	1	3	3	In order to delicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or fig or fig. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grass, g, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Right/dark,warm/cold.
968	1	2	2	There are several pieces of additional information needed to delicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. That size and configuration should the container be ? It says "identical", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?
969	1	0	0	Least three pieces of information I would need to delicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their container (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
970	1	3	2	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. When in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the container would also be vital to delicate the experiment.
972	1	2	2	The additional information needed to delicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to delicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very information.
975	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its container I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material that a major part of the experiment.
976	1	1	0	In order to be able to retreat this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost g, the limestone lost 1.g and the plastic lost g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosive, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pp in order to retreat this experiment
977	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what container they used. A person would also need to know if the container were covered or not during the experiment.
978	1	0	2	His experiment would need clot more information for it to be repeated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variable. Understanding that there needs to be a consistent amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
979	1	2	2	Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the container. Lastly, in order to delicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rise the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grass?).
980	1	1	1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. His is important to delicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the container and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
981	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into container what type of container have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rise each material rising  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to delicate the experiment would be what size do the container have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the container, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rise for, and how do I measure the mass ?
983	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.His additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
984	1	3	3	The group of students didn't specify what "samples" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the container in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said container. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the container in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rise the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to delicate the experiment.
985	1	0	0	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of container to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
986	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
987	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
988	1	2	2	Of I was to delicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
989	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measuring tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rise the samples for after the hours would be helpful in the replied of this experiment.
991	1	0	0	Of you wanted to delicate the order then you would have to double everything in the was trials that were provided for you.
992	1	2	2	Now much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. Now much of such sample should be used.
993	1	1	1	May the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
994	1	1	1	Now much vinegar do you pour in the four container.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurement of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of container they used. All this information is needed to delicate the experiment.
996	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be implicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
997	1	3	1	Now much basis was used in each container,rise with distilled water for how long .Now much the container have to be.
998	1	2	2	One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the container.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independent variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. His is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1000	1	0	1	Additional information you would need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. To if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with container without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different container. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1003	1	3	2	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1004	1	2	2	One would need to know may things in order to delicate the group's procedure. He would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the container and how big the container are themselves.
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To delicate this experiment we will also need to know under what conditions the samples an the vinegar will be in. He would need to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1006	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they container the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1007	1	3	3	He would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar how you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1009	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am passing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1010	1	2	2	In order to delicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of container I need.
1011	1	2	2	Additional information that I would need to know in order to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the container were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurement of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. Now much of the material they will to put into the container. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1013	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to delicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. Now much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to delicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four container. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1016	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four container.
1017	1	0	2	1. One thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than finger. 2. another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types, 2 plastic, and 2 woods. 3. instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could measure the mass with the finger and then ring it off and measure without the finger.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to delicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. In explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the and trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to delicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1021	1	2	2	1. That are the four different samples? ^p 2. Now much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. Now are you going to measure the mass?
1022	1	2	1	To delicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1024	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and dear in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'it say whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to know at what temperature distilled water has to be.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to delicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate container. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1028	1	0	0	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastic wood.
1029	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1030	1	3	3	1. That kind of samples ? ^p 2. Now much vinegar ? ^p 3. That kind of container ?
1031	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences practically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what materials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four container then place a sample of one material into one container and label. When after 24 hours rise each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1034	1	0	0	In order for me to delicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the container. And what does distilled water mean.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to delicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, container, sticks for laboring.A watch or time and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestone,wood and plastic.
1036	1	1	1	The information you need in order to delicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the container. Maybe you should also state what the container you are using look like.
1037	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additional for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the container would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environment could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different container would also affect the data.
1038	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be became sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1040	1	1	1	Now much vinegar should they put on each container.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rise each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1042	1	2	2	The groups procedure was missing the amount of vinegar to put into each of the container, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1044	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the container. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same container to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical container.
1045	1	2	2	After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. Now much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
1046	1	0	0	Take sure they start with the same mass.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1048	1	2	2	Of you were to delicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the container. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be either or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the container. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the container ?
1050	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the container which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rise the materials, four different container to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1051	1	1	1	I think that these brain made to for the
1052	1	0	1	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1053	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the container. You would need to know how big the container were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the container.
1054	1	0	0	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
1055	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. That container do I put them in? Now much vinegar do I put into the container? To just let the container sit out in room hemp for 24 hours? To I cover the container? Now do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1056	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the container, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1057	1	3	3	In order to delicate group's experiment we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the container and we would also need equal amount of each samples. He would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test that's label them with what they are then wait 4 awe's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1059	1	1	1	Of I would delicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. That would happen if the samples cut not dry within 30 minutes. Of you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushed that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. That do you use to measure the samples and when?
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rises it off exactly, in order to delicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature wishes of the solution better than another.
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the came container when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. Now many container you need.
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an experimental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. To more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1064	1	0	0	First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. When after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
1065	1	1	1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. Is well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the container after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to delicate the experiment.
1066	1	1	2	Additional information that would be needed top delicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vinegar to put into cups. Of they do not specify, then the results may come out completely different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marble + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the container used.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dams piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the excitement. You cannot delicate the excitement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropriate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to delicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four separate but identical container, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1071	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rise the samples with, where to place the container during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to reform will all that new information I will be able to reform a more valid experiment.
1072	1	2	2	In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
1073	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to retreat the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vague and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1074	1	0	0	That would need to delicate the experiment is the mass of four different samples, vinegar, retainers, and water.
1075	1	2	2	His group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical container, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the container.
1076	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variable ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indecent incapable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word"samples" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rise with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variable,because some sample retain water better than others (Good,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experiment should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grass.
1077	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical container, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and table then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1078	1	0	0	You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help delicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each baker. Of we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Unable what was need to determine be mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at the same mass so you don't get sewed results
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contains. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room hemp).
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the container. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1082	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of sores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the container.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are different it's easily affected the final result.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1085	1	0	0	That type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1086	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1087	1	0	0	needed to delicate this experiment
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are being used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is being used. You would need to know how long to rise the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rise them.
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent variable and independent variable.
1091	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four different samples in the procedure.
1092	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know how much finger to pour into the container, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1094	1	1	1	To delicate the groups procedure I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different samples such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vinegar should I poor into the the four identical container, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incise you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can me up.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rise the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to delicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. Now much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1098	1	2	2	After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size container, how much vinegar to put in the container.
1099	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the container. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the container.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1102	1	1	1	In order for myself or another to accurately delicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from "pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical container" to pour (amount in my) of vinegar in each. His extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self delicate the experiment accurately.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be implicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rise each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grass or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinegar. They should also add a control.
1105	1	0	0	That we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reply need to rise it more.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the container. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. His would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to delicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the container.
1107	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to delicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dried rocks.
1108	1	0	0	That you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1109	1	2	1	Additional information you would need to delicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of container needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured on each sample.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the container at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of container should you put the samples in? Now big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1111	1	2	2	Of I was going to delicate this experiment,I would need to know what the "samples" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the container and if I should measure it before I start.
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to delicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1113	1	2	1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. Now much vinegar was used. Now much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
1114	1	2	2	The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are different type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
1115	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the container and this will help in the application of the experiment.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Met done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, Is well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurement that can potentially affect data.
1117	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. Now big the materials were that they used what kind of container they were using.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four container. His is important because the vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.Of the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1120	1	0	0	Mind the difference in mass.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to delicate the experiment.
1122	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredient and the conclusion.
1123	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the container in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vinegar and the size of the 4 materials.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1125	1	2	2	The information that I would need to delicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group independent variable,dependent variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am laboring the container.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1127	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting ideas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four separate container. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the container while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the container too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1129	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup. I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure. I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar necessary to pour in the container. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to delicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the container.
1131	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment I would need to know what type of measurement item I would need to "determine the mass of each sample". Also I need the names of the samples that I need to use, such as marble or wood. Lastly, I need from the procedure, a control because I need to be told what I am testing for.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1133	1	3	3	That are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. Now much vinegar do you need to put into the container, how big does the sample need to be.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical container, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to delicate
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happened in this experiment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to delicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chat what happened and a conclusion.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four separate but identical container. Met it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1142	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1144	1	0	0	Place a sample of one material into one container and label, "repeat with remaining samples",meaning a sample into a single container.
1145	1	1	1	His group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to delicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the measures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a clause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definitely change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1147	1	0	0	In order to delicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical container and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
1148	1	3	3	The reliability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the container at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rise the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1149	1	1	1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. Of I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
1150	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the container, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1151	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. His information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
1152	1	0	0	Some additional information you need in order to delicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of container use glass bottles.
1153	1	0	1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rise the samples with distilled water in order to delicate the experiment.
1155	1	0	0	To delicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of container to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusion to what those results to the experiment are
1158	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1159	1	2	2	Some additional information would be,Swelling at the start of the procedure what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describe how much vinegar goes into each container.
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. He would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. He also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1161	1	3	3	In order to delicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1162	1	0	0	The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the e hours occur.
1163	1	3	2	The additional information you would need to delicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind. You would also need to know how they determined the mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup. It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in.
1164	1	1	1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the container was in the substances.
1165	1	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Well how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1166	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each container, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
1167	1	1	1	To take this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the container, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the container. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the container.
1168	1	3	3	The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the "4 different samples" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into container, I believe the container should be placed in the same location temperature as the others.
1169	1	0	1	Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vinegar and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grass it had gained with the material.
1170	1	0	1	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experience is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1171	1	3	2	In order to make the group's experiment more delicate, the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable. Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample? Thirdly, in order to both make the experiment more delicate and improve the validity, a control should be tested. In an experiment like this, the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled H2O.
1172	1	2	2	To delicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container might contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. You would also need to know how many mrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to delicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1174	1	2	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repute the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurement of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic container, put the rocks in the container in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stone sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of miner that being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1178	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rise the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1179	1	0	0	-Change the amount of have. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Your vinegar in each of for separate, but different container.
1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to delicate the experiment is what the hemp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rise it with in question , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of container to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1182	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to delicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labelled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
1183	1	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigation, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to delicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the container so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 container, some vine-war and label sticks. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1185	1	1	1	These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's order to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate container. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
1186	1	0	0	Maybe put more mass in the wood and love it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mind.
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1188	1	0	1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. That about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. Now about the container? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grass.
1189	1	0	0	Well they all got diffident number of there project cause of the marya got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1190	1	3	3	He would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. He would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the application samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. He would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1191	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in.

1223	1	1	1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the container containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the pad in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end

1284	1	2	2	You would need to know what materials to use, the amount of vinegar to use, and.
1285	1	3	3	In order to replicat the excitement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for "samples", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four container, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rise each sample in the distilled water.
1286	1	0	0	Well Am not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. To it would have a different answer.
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to delicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. That the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1288	1	0	0	I would have 4 container called the is marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know what in the container then poured a even amount of vinegar on each same. Met it sit & dry out for 24 hours & determine the mass I got at the end could compared it to the mass I got in the begging fig.
1289	1	3	3	To delicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To delicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the container they were put in.

1291	1	0	0	Hypothesis to take a guess  whether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right. ^p Independent  dependent variable in the students experiment ^p Results - The would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
1292	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/is and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubation.
1293	1	3	3	To delicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rise the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1294	1	2	2	In order in delicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical container, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not nothing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
1295	1	2	2	That the samples are, what type of container.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to delicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical container.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1298	1	2	1	I would need the size of the container. Now or what the temperature of the water that they used to rise the samples.
1299	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how much sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1300	1	1	3	In order to delicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate container. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1302	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to table each container with the difference in each one.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 separate container. And then mass the container so you can subtracted the weight of the container when you mass the samples. His will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1305	1	0	0	You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical container. His is to delicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to delicate this experiment.
1306	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the container. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completely, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completely submerged or if it was floating on top.
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to delicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of container they used would also be useful information.
1308	1	1	1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
1309	1	0	0	Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
1310	1	0	0	The additional information we would need to delicate the experiment would be the conclusion.
1311	1	2	3	Additional information I would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing, how much vinegar to pour into the separate container, how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar, what I would put the samples in after I remove them, and how I would determine the mass of each sample. These things are needed to delicate the experiment exactly or else I would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container In how much of each  sample.  In what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to delicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to delicate this experiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does temperature play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the aridity of the acid(ak)vinegar.
1314	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to add to the container. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
1315	1	0	0	Take a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1316	1	2	2	In order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure,one must know what the four samples are. The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well. Also,the person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass (grains).
1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate container. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . To they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1319	1	2	2	There do we keep the container? Now much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much finger was poured in each container. Of each container had different mass of finger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of finger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grass, plastic being 7.2 grass and wood being 11.2 grass, how is the mass of each determined?
1323	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,whether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1325	1	2	3	To delicate this experiment project, you would need to know what type of container were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the container. Also, you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar, how much distilled water you need to rise it with and how well.
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
1327	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Finger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to table each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the container were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to delicate the experiment.
1329	1	3	3	To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additional to the procedure
1330	1	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be implicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
1331	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is "9.8" the ending mass is "9.4" and the difference in mass is "0.4." Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was "10.4" for starting mass,"9.1" ending mass, "-1.3" difference mass now for the wood students got "11.2". Starting mass "11.2" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass.
1332	1	2	2	Now much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the container, and which type of scale would i use?
1333	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the container. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
1334	1	1	1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the container? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
1335	1	1	1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be poured into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1336	1	2	2	1.)Now much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the container will affect your results ?
1337	1	1	0	To delicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials and the time to do this project.
1338	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You would need to know how much vinegar is being added to the container. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is necessary to know how to label the different container since they are identical.
1339	1	2	2	The additional information you would need order to delicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each container, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid western.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to delicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1341	1	2	2	In order for someone to delicate the experiment, this group should have immediately include, the names of the four samples substances. Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. His group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When implicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
1342	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but identical, container. When you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1344	1	2	2	For this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples.That were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light, dark rooms and temperature.Should you do the experiment twice one in light room,one dark different hemp.Now should the container be placed?
1345	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of native i used as so i would need a scope to wight the motive before they get tremens and after to make the steps easy they could have said repeat steps 2 & 3 for each different motive used.
1346	1	2	2	Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm using which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1348	1	0	0	1 Met the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Cry different container, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Cry more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Met samples sit larger than 24 hours.
1349	1	3	3	In order to delicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1350	1	1	1	To delicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the container.
1351	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate container in step 2. Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure. A third piece of information would be how much water you should rise each sample with after the 24 hours.
1352	1	0	0	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
1353	1	1	1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurement  of the vinegar.
1354	1	2	2	To delicate this groups experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should use, what samples to use (incise the graph wasn't shown, then I wouldn't know) and lastly I would need to know how to determine the mass. Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass. In the procedure it should say "determine the mass by..."
1355	1	0	0	Some information you will need in order to delicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this experiment one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistent in order for the experiment to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatus used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1357	1	2	1	Additional information to delicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the container. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
1358	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and content,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1359	1	1	1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1361	1	1	1	Now do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinegar.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labelled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the container and allow it to dry.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. When you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1365	1	1	2	Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. That also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when implicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the container. I would also need to know what type of container are being used and where to put these container during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to delicate it.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminium foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pulse using aluminium foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The ilium paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1370	1	2	3	You would need to know what materials to get. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. They should have told us what to measure the cup with. They should have also told us what type of container to use.
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of container I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to delicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical into. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to make the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the container. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if implicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. In other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to delicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. That is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1379	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensils to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how much vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1381	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your container.
1382	1	2	2	His procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to delicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurement of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a brief introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. That kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were the masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what needs to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the container would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1386	1	3	3	In order to delicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeated it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1388	1	0	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the experiment to delicate it.
1389	1	2	2	I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p Now much vinegar would I pour into the bearers. ^p That materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1391	1	2	2	Now much vinegar are the poring? Now long are we rinsing them?
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the container.
1393	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1394	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, "determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to delicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 container.
1395	1	1	1	That I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to delicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. In additional piece of information that would help delicate this experiment is how long should you rise each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1397	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the container and then where to place the samples during the their in the container and out.
1398	1	0	0	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to delicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
1401	1	2	2	In order to delicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and you would need to know how long to prince each container after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1402	1	0	0	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to delicate the experiment.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rise each sample should be stated.
1404	1	2	2	One additional price would be to state the materials needed offer additional pale would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peace  would be to marie all the materials the same ending mass.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. Now much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the container and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1406	1	3	3	To delicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. Of they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1407	1	2	2	The additional information that you would need in order to delicate the experiment are what type of climate the container have to be in, the size of the container, and the thickness of the insulating material.
1408	1	0	0	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
1409	1	0	0	In order to delicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constant ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
1410	1	2	2	The additional information I would need is to know what size the container should be. I would need to know what to label the container. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
1411	1	3	2	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amounts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rise the material in a timely manner (10 see, 20 see etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
1412	1	0	0	Good starting mass (g) 11.2
1413	1	3	3	Of someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.Of being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of container are used.Maybe restrain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yale would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yale would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each individual sample.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the container should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could delicate this lab.
1416	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of container are being used.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to delicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate container. Also you might say how long to rise the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1419	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical container.
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtracted the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to delicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the container. He would also need to know what the units are if their grass and mrs.
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to delicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical container. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the container, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1422	1	0	0	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we support to not in the container.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinegar to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1424	1	0	0	On't know.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? That should we table the 4 container as ? Now should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the container? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	The three things that need to be added to delicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. It the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. It the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
1429	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1430	1	1	1	They would also need to include how much vinegar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to delicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1432	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rise each sample as well. Such more information is needed in order to accurately delicate this experiment.
1433	1	3	3	In able to delicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) That are the samples. ^p 2) Now much vinegar is poured into the 4 container. ^p 3) That unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) That kind of container were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a meaning cup the nearer the mass of energy. When we get plastic of starting mass.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? Now much vinegar do I pour in each of the container? That do I do to the materials or container before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1436	1	1	1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the container. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain it.
1437	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppose the of of aridity of the vinegar. The surface area of the ranks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
1438	1	1	1	a. Well how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the container how long do I ring the sample for.
1440	1	1	1	That are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. Now much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1441	1	0	0	To delicate this experiment and make if beef you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to delicate this experiment would include: ^p - That kind of four samples are being used. ^p - Now much vinegar to pour into the container. ^p - That kind of container are being used. ^p - Now to to remove the samples and place them into container. ^p - That to label each of the separate container.
1443	1	2	2	First of all in order to delicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to delicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
1444	1	3	3	To delicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. Now much vinegar they used, how big the container were and what they were made of and what samples they used. Of they added those things in the procedure you would be able to delicate their experiment.
1445	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific all of the vinegar which is pacific, therefore it would be below it. He would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before implicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the container because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the container. Also they didn't table each measurement on the chart.
1447	1	0	0	In order to be able to red this experiment, you need to have all of the information. He need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the fired time that you did the experiment. Well what happen how in the first experiment.
1449	1	1	1	To delicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the container. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to delicate the experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To implicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1451	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment you would need to know how many mrs of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rise the samples with. To delicate this experiment you would need to know what type of container to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1454	1	1	1	Now much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1456	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a cripple beam before to measure.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be pheasant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where are supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1458	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rise each sample. Without these you cannot delicate the experiment.
1459	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the container. I would also need to know the environment in which the container where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1460	1	2	2	First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I was wish water. When finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. To that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to delicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the container, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1463	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1464	1	0	0	Well us to do it again.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rise the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1466	1	3	3	In order to delicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the conversation of the vinegar. Of when the experiment is implicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occur.
1467	1	0	1	May what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the contains, and how do you determine the mass?
1469	1	2	1	In order to delicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. That are the four different samples. That type of container will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the hemp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistent)
1472	1	2	2	I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the container so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
1473	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
1474	1	3	3	To delicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  container. And lastly, to delicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1475	1	2	2	To delicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as hemp affects the results of them runs.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. Now much vinegar they used and if the container was covered or not.
1477	1	2	1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to delicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valuable instead of other samples most for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and container. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. His is the same information I would need to delicate the experiment.
1478	1	0	0	To far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Met sit for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtracted the difference.
1479	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was cried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mind. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of container  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Was in step two it does not tell you the amount of finger to pour into the container.
1481	1	3	2	To delicate the "Acid Aim Experiment" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance.
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to still each sample with.
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1484	1	2	2	You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to delicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the container are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
1485	1	2	2	Although they got some information, I think that in order to delicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the container. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. Of they were to delicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1487	1	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1488	1	0	1	The additional information I would need to delicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
1489	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature thought the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submerged completely or not.
1491	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure, to delicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical container, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1492	1	3	3	In order to delicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. That type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. Now much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what size container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environment th samples may dry at a different speed.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1494	1	0	0	First the state mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the container. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rise the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variable if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1497	1	0	0	1) Father materials. ^p 2) Your 20 my vinegar in each of four separate out identical container. ^p 3) Place a samoa of the material into the container and label. Serpent with remaining placing a strikes sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the container and lines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mind. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1498	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the container, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, container were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rise off the samples, and for how long did the students rise the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were passed in order to delicate the experiment.
1499	1	0	0	The additional information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. Of shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prospects are created)
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the Of separate container, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1501	1	1	1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the excitement be more exact. Another way to improve this excitement is to have more trials because there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didn tell us the different samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps order to understand it.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1506	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rise the samples.
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the container because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1508	1	2	2	In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
1509	1	2	3	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (in in my) should be described as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/baker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to delicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the container so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to delicate the experiment.
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to delicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1512	1	2	2	His experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rise each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1513	1	3	3	That the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 he waiting period.
1514	1	1	1	Want wise the shops, if they waved with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinsed did put in it.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want necessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to delicate the experiment.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into container. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rise the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validity the excitement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temperature of the area in which the excitement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temperature needs to be known for the excitement to be valid.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could delicate it. That else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of container (how big) each of them are.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to delicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the container so that the experiment would be implicated.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional information I would need to delicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the container.
1522	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1523	1	0	0	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the container and rise each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
1524	1	1	1	Additional information that you would need to delicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the container that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1526	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to delicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of "one material" in each cup. I have an idea how much "one material" is.
1527	1	0	0	To delicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. That is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variable.
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the container at.
1529	1	1	1	Now all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1530	1	2	2	The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p Now much distilled water you would need to rise
1531	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the container and how long to rise the samples for.
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1533	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to delicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of container needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to delicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. Of not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the container and you need to know how long to rise each sample and where the samples should dry.
1535	1	3	3	Of I wanted to delicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of container to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the container I would also need to know what the samples are. Now am I suppose to know what I am wasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. He need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rise the samples for.
1537	1	2	3	I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need beck down the steps.
1539	1	2	2	To properly delicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the " four different samples" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the " separate, identical container" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only "place in in single sample in a single container.
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to delicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variable.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experiment control, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1543	1	1	1	To delicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the container, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1544	1	0	0	1. Father materials. ^p 2. But on apron & gorges. ^p 3. Met up materials. ^p 4. For vinegar into a identical container. ^p 5. But marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate container. ^p 6. But name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Since the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. But samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to delicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate bearers.I would also need to know what is the of size of the identical baker of size altered or not. The
1546	1	1	1	First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grass. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these container.
1547	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1549	1	2	2	One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
1550	1	1	2	His group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to delicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to delicate the experiment better.
1551	1	3	3	The group neglected to include what the "four different samples" are. They should have said, "use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in container. They should have included how much (my) vinegar should be poured into each container, what container are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would delicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredient.
1553	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grass. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundredth of the gram.
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to delicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1555	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment form a hypothesis. Raw a conclusion. May what you are experimenting.
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to delicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different container.
1557	1	2	2	To delicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
1558	1	3	2	One thing missing from this experiment is the precise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1559	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinsing samples and letting each sit for 30 minutes you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you said first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the container. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You said also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the container, where would they sit?
1561	1	0	0	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four container and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the container. When put
1562	1	0	0	Of you want to delicate the experiment you will need more container exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of finger.
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1564	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen specific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1565	1	3	3	To delicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to delicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of container these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed container?
1567	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the container. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1568	1	1	1	In order to delicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly implicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1569	1	0	0	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Take up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to delicate this I would need to know the container size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1571	1	2	2	Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the container. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word "materials" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar.
1572	1	2	2	To delicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the container,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the container.
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rise each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1574	1	1	2	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinegar was put in to the container when you started. When when you finish how much vinegar was in the container.
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to delicate this experiment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1576	1	1	1	To delicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say measure the starting weight of the samples.
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1578	1	1	1	His group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you can guess for how much to put in.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what hemp the distilled water should be.
1580	1	3	3	The groups procedure could  use, they could add to find the difference in mass at the end. Also list the type of general they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they roused.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)Now much vinegar to put the samples in.
1582	1	0	0	In order for me to delicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
1583	1	0	0	While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final answer that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1585	1	3	2	In order to delicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rise each sample of the vinegar.
1586	1	0	0	To delicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p His will give you data to base your exam findings onto.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the container, what are the four samples to put something over the container, and what are steps of the samples.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. He want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1589	1	1	1	In order to delicate this excitement they would have to
1590	1	3	2	Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the container.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to delicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the container and what kind of container. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to delicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1593	1	0	0	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o the container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the container back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
1594	1	2	2	In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also state how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
1595	1	1	2	Additional information needed to delicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the container. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are calling should be stated. Now are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
1596	1	1	1	Why they are doing this experiment?  what the problem is how much vinegar is needed. That is the control  for the experiment ;
1597	1	0	0	That I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. He they repeat it.
1598	1	0	0	Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses losses to complete the experiment.
1599	1	0	0	One piece of information needed to delicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are putting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to delicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each container. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the container looked like, so i know what kind of container i should checking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constant for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the container also will need four container a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1605	1	0	0	The following additional information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
1606	1	0	1	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can delicate the experiment.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1608	1	2	2	Six this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of container. When it needs to state how much of each "sample". His procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly.
1609	1	1	1	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
1610	1	0	0	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
1611	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four container then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1613	1	1	2	There are three things you would need to know to delicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four container. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the procedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constant.
1614	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to know to delicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the container what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independent and dependent factor.
1615	1	2	2	His group needs to include quantitative information such as, "Now much vinegar". His group should try to eliminate the use of the word "sample", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in proportion to how much of the material.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the container. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1618	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Must saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 my amount of vinegar is needed to delicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1619	1	3	3	1.Now much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.That temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Since samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in particular. To you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? Now long do I rise the sample in distilled water for?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different container. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1623	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the container should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1625	1	1	1	st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all container and try wasting day the days to see what would happen.
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. He do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1628	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to delicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the container (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (in grass, pounds,couples)
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1630	1	3	3	To delicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a baker  graduated cylinder or a crucial or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1631	1	2	2	To delicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) That samples. ^p 2) Now much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) Now much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
1632	1	3	2	Of I were to delicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my container need to be.
1635	1	2	2	First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
1636	1	1	0	Some additional information that we would need in order to delicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
1637	1	2	2	In order to delicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. He would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to delicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1639	1	1	1	In order to delicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. Now to determine the mass of the samples. That materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to delicate the experiment.
1641	1	2	2	First you would name the four distant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more specific and valid for this lab to be repeated
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independent variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variable are controlled.
1643	1	2	2	To delicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their container. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment pressed.
1644	1	1	1	In order to delicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. He also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could delicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1645	1	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the students weren't very clear on what the samples were. Of they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. To if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriptive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to delicate this experiment is what size container will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1648	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical make and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1649	1	2	2	The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be implicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
1650	1	0	0	In order to delicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1652	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the container. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produce like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1654	1	2	2	Of you were to delicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1657	1	2	2	I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four container. I would also need to know where to leave the container from hemp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
1658	1	3	3	To delicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the container. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variable if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to delicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the container; how big or small the container have to be; and whether or not I should close the container.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each separate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the container in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
1661	1	3	3	In order to delicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquid, crushed whole etc).
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to delicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the control to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can delicate the acid rain experiment.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety gorges and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. To, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water the sample and it needs to elaborate.
1664	1	3	3	In order to delicate the "acid rain" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. That are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four separate but identical container. That is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the th step, it says, to rise each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?
1665	1	2	2	In order to delicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the container should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is implicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. Now much sample to add into each solution. In order to delicate this experiment.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to delicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. Now much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each container for example (in*in) marble square.
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to delicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1669	1	0	0	Number 2, pour vinegar in each of the four separate not identical container. His can help determine the mass of each item and help with the experiment from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determine the mass.
