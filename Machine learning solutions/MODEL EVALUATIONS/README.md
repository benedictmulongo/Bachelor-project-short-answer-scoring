#MODEL EVALUATION

Use the python script model_evaluation.py to evaluate the machine learning model implemented. There are two classifiers implemented : 
logistic regression, naive bayes and random forest. 
You can choose to either test the model with 19 features or the model with bag-of-words. You can also choose to compute the features
(lot of computation time) or use the precomputed features vectors as default. The bag-of-words model are much faster and can be computed
if needed.
